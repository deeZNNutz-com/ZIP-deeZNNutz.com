# dZIP.deeZNNutz

**What is an a dZIP?** dZIP stands for distributed Zenon Improvement Proposal. dZIP is a framework to provide structured facilitation of an idea to software upgrade.

dZIPs are fault tolerant.  There is no central repository or editor who accepts or rejects dZIPs.  dZIPs are proposed by the community to Pillars.  If a Pillar supports a dZIP they will broadcast that support by publishing the dZIP on github, gitlab, IPFS, or some other public broadcast channel with a numbering system.  If other Pillars support the iniative they will signal support by referencing the the dZIP proposal in their own public broadcast channel. The Zenon community will maintain a "dZIP Pointer Service" repository which points to all the available dZIP broadcast channels supported by Pillars. This Pointer Service is centrally managed and provided as an administrative function by the Zenon community to make it easier to search all dZIPs.  
> Proposed Naming Convention:  dZIP:[Pillar Name]-[Number]
