# dZIP.deeZNNutz

**What is an a dZIP?** dZIP stands for distributed Zenon Improvement Proposal. dZIP is a framework to provide structured facilitation of an idea to software upgrade.

dZIPs are fault tolerant.  There is no central repository or editor who accepts or rejects dZIPs.  dZIPs are proposed by the community to Pillars.  If a Pillar supports a dZIP they will broadcast that support by publishing the dZIP on github, gitlab, IPFS, or some other public broadcast channel with a numbering system.  If other Pillars support the iniative they will signal support by referencing the the dZIP proposal in their own public broadcast channel. The community will maintain a "dZIP Pointer Service" repository on github which points to all the available dZIP broadcast channels supported by Pillars.

**How does a dZIP get implemented?**
- Sharing of ideas
- Feedback and discussion
